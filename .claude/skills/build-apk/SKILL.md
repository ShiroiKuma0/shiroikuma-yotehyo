description: Build the signed foss release APK with the buildFoss Gradle task. Build PROACTIVELY as soon as a coherent code change is complete and compiles — do NOT wait for the user to say "build it". Then deliver the APK automatically via the global /after-build skill (adb push if a phone is connected, else scp to skhw — no transfer prompt). Also use whenever the user explicitly asks to build the app, build the APK, make a release build, or build and send to the phone.

# Build the foss release APK and optionally send to phone

## When to build

Build **proactively** — do NOT wait for the user to say "build it" and do NOT ask "want me to
build?" first. As soon as you have finished a coherent set of code changes and they compile, run the
steps below. Don't rebuild after every tiny intermediate edit — build once the change is in a
testable state.

This removes only the *ask-before-build* wait. Delivery is now automatic too: after a successful
build, send the APK via the global **/after-build** skill (step 3) — no transfer prompt, no asking
"scp or adb push?" or "is the phone connected?". The repo's commit/push rules are unchanged.

## Steps

1. **Note the output filename.** Read the current version and build number:
   - `grep -E 'VERSION_NAME|BUILD_NUMBER' gradle.properties`
   - The APK will be `shiroikuma-yotehyo_<VERSION_NAME>+<BUILD_NUMBER>_arm64-v8a.apk`, using the `BUILD_NUMBER` value **before** the build (the task bumps it afterward).

2. **Build** (the toolchain needs JDK 21 — the default `java` on PATH is too old for AGP 9.x):
   - `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64 ./gradlew buildFoss < /dev/null`  (the `< /dev/null` guarantees it never blocks on stdin — see caveat)
   - This runs `assembleFossRelease`, copies the signed APK to `~/tmp/<apk name>`, and auto-increments `BUILD_NUMBER` in `gradle.properties`.
   - The task prints `>>> ~/tmp/<apk name>`; use that line to confirm the exact filename, and confirm `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.

3. **Deliver automatically via the global /after-build skill** — every build, no asking. After the signed APK is in `~/tmp/`, invoke **/after-build**: it runs `/adb-check` UNSANDBOXED (a sandboxed check falsely reports no device), then `/adb-push` to `/sdcard/tmp/` if a phone is connected, otherwise `/scp` to `skhw:~/tmp/`, and announces the filename. Never install the APK — only push it to `/sdcard/tmp/`; the user installs it manually.

## Caveat — why deliver directly instead of via the task

The `buildFoss` task (`app/build.gradle.kts`) has an interactive `read -p "Push to phone? (y/n)"` prompt, but it runs in a subprocess of the **Gradle daemon**, whose stdin/stdout are not connected to Claude's Bash tool. Piping `y`/`n` into `./gradlew buildFoss` does not reach the prompt — the daemon subprocess gets EOF, silently skips the push, and its output is invisible. So the task's prompt is effectively dead under this tooling: deliver the APK yourself via the **/after-build** skill.

## Signing

Release signing is non-interactive: `app/build.gradle.kts` reads credentials from `keystore.properties` (falling back to `SIGNING_*` env vars). This fork reuses the `shiroikuma-denwa` keystore (`/home/shiroikuma/.android-keystores/shiroikuma-denwa.jks`, alias `denwa`). If neither `keystore.properties` nor the env vars are present the build is unsigned and the APK will not install.

## Prerequisite — patched Commons in mavenLocal

This app builds against our patched Fossify Commons (`commons = "6.1.6-sk2"` in
`gradle/libs.versions.toml`), resolved from `mavenLocal()` (`~/.m2`). On this machine it is already
published, so `buildFoss` just works. **On a fresh machine, or if `~/.m2` was cleared**, the build fails
with `Could not resolve org.fossify:commons:6.1.6-sk2` — publish it first:

```bash
cd ~/git/shiroikuma-commons && JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64 \
  ./gradlew :commons:publishToMavenLocal -PVERSION=6.1.6-sk2
```

See the `shiroikuma-commons` repo's CLAUDE.md for the patch details.

**Commit convention — no Claude attribution.** Never add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` / "Generated with Claude" trailer to commit messages or PR bodies; end the message at the last line of the body. This overrides the harness default. (Global rule: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.)
